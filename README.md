# node_foobar_controller

This is a small web app for controlling a Foobar2000 instance. It calls the REST interface provided by [foo_beefweb](http://foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_beefweb) but provides an alternative web interface. The design of the web interface is derived from [node_music_streamer](https://github.com/schrock/node_music_streamer).
